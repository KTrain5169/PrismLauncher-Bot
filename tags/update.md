Windows auto-updating is only supported on 8.0+. For Prism 7.2 or below, you will need to download the installer and run it again in order to update. On 8.0 or newer, click the 'Update' button. You will not lose your instances.

Prism Launcher auto-updates for macOS using the [Sparkle Framework](https://sparkle-project.org/).

For Linux, just use your package manager! Otherwise, AppImage and portable auto-updating was added in 8.0.
