title: Please don't crosspost your support questions!

Crossposting is generally defined as posting the same or similar content across multiple channels. While it may seem like a good idea to post your request across multiple channels, this is in fact really disruptive to any conversations going on in those channels.

Generally, crossposting support requests is accepted if you originally posted in the quick-support channel, but the problem becomes complicated enough to warrant its own thread in either launcher-support or mod-support, depending on the possible cause of the problem.
