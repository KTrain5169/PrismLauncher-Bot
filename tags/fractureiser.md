Starting June 6th, 2023 UTC, there have been reports of malware being distributed through websites such as Curseforge, Bukkit, and possibly others in the form of mods, plugins, and modpacks. According to both [Modrinth](https://twitter.com/modrinth/status/1666853947804463115) and [Curseforge](https://twitter.com/CurseForge/status/1666741580022128641), all infected files have been removed. These services should be safe to use now, however users should still take caution in downloading files, especially from less trustworthy services.

This is a complex situation, and for a full explanation you should go to [this](https://github.com/fractureiser-investigation/fractureiser) GitHub repository. We have also provided resources to help users find out if they have been affected [here](https://prismlauncher.org/news/cf-compromised-alert/#what-can-i-do). This includes scripts for both Windows and Linux (the operating systems known to be affected so far) to help you find files used by Fractureiser.

In the case files are found, they should be deleted - however, we still recommend to **change all of your passwords**, especially for accounts with login information saved in your browser. There are also tools such as [NekoDetector](https://github.com/MCRcortex/nekodetector) that allow you to check for any Java files that could place these files on your computer again, and a [web app](https://douira.github.io/fractureiser-web-detector/) that allows you to scan individual mods.
